## 🆕 2. RECENT UPGRADES (DEPLOYED TODAY)

### 🧠 A. "The Critic" (Self-Correction Layer)
*   **Problem**: First-pass AI drafts can be "flat" or repetitive.
*   **Solution**: Added a recursive loop in `aiServiceWrapper.ts`.
*   **How it works**:
    1.  AI writes draft.
    2.  AI switches to "Critic Persona" and identifies 3 weaknesses.
    3.  AI rewrites the content based on its own feedback.
*   **Status**: **Live in Core Engine**.

### 🧭 B. Smart Upload Co-Pilot
*   **Problem**: Users fear the Amazon KDP upload screen (rejection anxiety).
*   **Solution**: A simulator that mirrors Amazon's interface inside the app.
*   **Features**:
    *   Pre-fills Title, Description, Keywords from Blueprint.
    *   Simulates "Audit" progress bar to build confidence.
    *   Royalty Calculator shows profit margins instantly.
*   **Status**: **Integrated & Launchable** via the "Launch Smart Upload Co-Pilot" button.

## 🛡️ 3. COMPLIANCE & SAFETY AUDIT

Our system currently enforces the **Amazon KDP "Safe" Standard**:

*   **Bleed Check**: ✅ 0.125" tolerance verified.
*   **Trim Sizes**: ✅ Supports Standard (6x9), Trade (5.5x8.5), and Square (8.5x8.5).
*   **AI Disclosure**: ✅ Prompts user to copy/paste AI disclosure status (Tier 1 Compliance).
*   **Copyright**: ✅ Auto-generates copyright page with year and author name.

## ⚠️ 4. REMAINING GAPS & NEXT STEPS

While the system is robust, two "future" features remain in the pipeline:

1.  **Adaptive Intelligence Core**: The system does not yet "learn" from user success (requires a database of sales data).
    *   *Mitigation*: We use static "Best Seller" formulas updated monthly.
2.  **Proof of Originality Certificate**:
    *   *Status*: Data exists (logs), but the physical PDF certificate generator is not built.
    *   *Mitigation*: The "Compliance Report" in the UI serves this purpose for now.

The KDP Book Lab is no longer a prototype. It is a **commercial-grade publishing engine** capable of producing market-ready books with minimal human intervention.

**Recommended Action**:
1.  Navigate to **KDP Book Lab**.
2.  Generate a Blueprint.
3.  Test the **Smart Upload Co-Pilot** to experience the new workflow.
