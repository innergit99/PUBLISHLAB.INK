# 🚀 Action Plan: Mission Tomorrow

## 🌟 Achievements Unlocked Today
*   **Creative Visual Engine**: Replaced generic gradients with proper **Genre-Specific Procedural Patterns** (Sci-Fi Circuits, Fantasy Runes, Thriller Radars).
*   **PDF Consistency**: Fixed the export pipeline so the **Print Wrap PDF** matches the **Master Preview** 100% (WYSIWYG).
*   **Chapter Art Upgrade**: Implemented "Industrial Interior Plates" where chapters get custom background art + giant drop-cap watermarks instead of blank pages.
*   **Project Rescue System**: Built and deployed **Backup (.json)** and **Restore** features to prevent data loss.
*   **Pollinations Fix**: Hard-coded the system to skip low-quality Pollinations fallbacks for KDP.

## 📅 Mission Plan for Tomorrow

### 1. 🧠 Loki Integration (Context Persistence)
*   **Objective**: User mentioned "Loki" is missing.
*   **Action**: Fully integrate the **Loki Context Engine** into the KDP Book Lab.
*   **Goal**: Allow the AI to remember specific character details, plot twists, and tone across different sessions without needing manual re-entry.

### 2. 💎 UI/UX Polish & Backup Visibility
*   **Objective**: User couldn't find the new Backup/Restore buttons easily.
*   **Action**: Move the **Project Rescue** controls to a dedicated, high-visibility "Command Bar" at the top of the dashboard.
*   **Goal**: Ensure you never feel anxiety about losing work again.

### 3. 🎨 Visual Engine: Phase 2 (Symbology)
*   **Objective**: "Canvas designs are missing... make it more robust."
*   **Action**: Expand the `drawProceduralPattern` engine with **20+ new distinct symbols** (Scales of Justice for Legal Thrillers, Blood Splatters for Horror, Cyber-glitch for Dystopian).
*   **Goal**: Make the "Fallback" look so good it feels like a "Primary" design choice.

### 4. ☁️ Cloud Sync (Optional but Recommended)
*   **Objective**: Move beyond local `.json` files.
*   **Action**: Investigate enabling a true "Cloud Save" to the backend (Supabase/Postgres) if available in your stack.
*   **Goal**: Auto-save your work to the cloud every 5 minutes.
