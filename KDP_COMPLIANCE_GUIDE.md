# KDP PREFLIGHT VALIDATOR: USER GUIDE
**Integrated into Artisan AI Book Lab**

Your project is now automatically scanned for 29+ compliance points before export.

## 🛡️ AUTO-CHECKS PERFORMED

### 1. 🚫 Critical Rejection Blockers (Errors)
These issues will cause Amazon to instantly reject your file. We block export until fixed.
*   **Placeholders**: We scan for `[INSERT NAME]`, `Lorem Ipsum`, `Title Here`.
*   **Missing Content**: Empty chapters or zero-word segments.
*   **Manga Length**: Manga under 40 pages (Amazon minimum) is flagged.

### 2. ⚠️ Quality & Safety Warnings
These won't block upload but may hurt sales or result in "suppressed" listings.
*   **Spine Text Eligibility**: If page count < 79 (approx 20k words), your book is too thin for text on the spine.
*   **Copyright Risk**: Mentions of major IPs (Disney, Marvel, etc.) triggers a "Fair Use" warning context.
*   **Trim Size Mismatch**: Checks if your selected trim matches your genre norms.

### 3. 🧠 Smart Logic Checks
*   **Page Count Calculation**: We estimate pages based on 250 words/page (standard trade paperback).
*   **Genre Rules**: 
    *   *Coloring Books*: Enforced single-sided page counts.
    *   *Thrillers*: Pacing check (Coming Soon).

## 🚀 HOW TO FIX ERRORS
*   **Placeholders**: Use the editor to Ctrl+F and replace generic text.
*   **Low Page Count**: Increase font size (in formatting settings) or add "Bonus Content" chapters.
*   **Copyright**: Ensure you differ significantly from the trademarked term.
