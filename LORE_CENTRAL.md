# 📖 Project Lore & Research Central

## 🧩 Feature: Manuscript Upload + Context-Aware Rewrite Engine (“Genesis Editor AI”)
*Integrated into KDP Book Lab Phase 1.*

### 🧠 Concept Summary
A user uploads any **PDF / DOCX / TXT** file containing partial or complete manuscript text.
The system:
1. **Analyzes structure, tone, and style.**
2. **Understands genre.**
3. **Detects flow breaks and formatting errors.**
4. **Rewrites or suggests improvements.**

### ⚙️ System Flow
`UPLOAD FILE` → `PARSER` → `CONTEXT ANALYZER` → `REWRITE ENGINE` → `HUMANIZATION LAYER` → `EXPORT`

### 🔧 User Modes
1. **🛠 Fix My Errors**: Grammar, sentence clarity, flow.
2. **🧠 Full Rewrite**: High-intensity regeneration with CIN logic.
3. **🎨 Style Enhancement**: Keeps original voice but adds depth/imagery.
4. **🚀 Continue Writing**: Context-aware generation of the next chapter.
