Due to the complexity of the fixes needed, I'm creating a comprehensive fix document. Please restart the dev server after I complete all changes.

## CRITICAL FIXES IN PROGRESS:

1. Reversing AI priority (Ollama primary, Gemini fallback)
2. Fixing duplicate chapter titles
3. Fixing title generation timeout
4. Fixing cover generation
5. Fixing downloads

Please wait for all fixes to complete before restarting.
