# 🏗️ Artisan AI: Professional Website Roadmap

## Goal: Transform the engine into a high-conversion, professional marketing site.

---

## 💎 Phase 1: Brand Identity & Visual Polish (High Priority)
*Status: In Progress*
- [x] **Premium 3D Hero Visual**: Generated industrial studio background.
- [ ] **Custom Logo Suite**: Create SVG-based logo variants (Light/Dark/Icon).
- [ ] **Typography Uniformity**: Ensure "Plus Jakarta Sans" and "JetBrains Mono" are consistent across all sub-pages.
- [ ] **Industrial Color Palette**: Fine-tune the "Slate-to-Indigo" gradient for maximum readability.

## 🏎️ Phase 2: Visitor Experience (UX)
*Goal: Remove all friction for new users.*
- [ ] **Mobile-First Optimization**: Ensure the site looks stunning on iPhones/Androids (Navigation drawer).
- [ ] **Interactive "Live Preview"**: A small demo area where visitors can see a book being generated without signing up.
- [ ] **One-Click CTA**: "Start Building" button must be visible in the header at all times.
- [ ] **Smooth Transitions**: Use intersection observers for "reveal on scroll" effects.

## 📈 Phase 3: Trust & Social Proof
*Goal: Prove that the engine works.*
- [ ] **Real Gallery Integration**: Synchronize the website gallery with actual user creations (KDP Covers).
- [ ] **KDP Compliance Badges**: Display verified "Amazon Safe" stamps and "Zero-GPU" performance metrics.
- [ ] **Wall of Love**: Interactive testimonial carousel (even if starting with early tester quotes).
- [ ] **Case Studies**: "How [User] generated a 10-book series in 48 hours."

## 🛠️ Phase 4: Technical & SEO
*Goal: Be found and load fast.*
- [ ] **Dynamic Metadata**: Meta titles/descriptions for "AI KDP Generator," "Industrial POD Tools."
- [ ] **Performance Audit**: Lazy-load the 3D hero image to ensure <1.5s load time.
- [ ] **Accessibility (a11y)**: Proper alt tags and ARIA labels for screen readers.

---

## 💰 Phase 5: Monetization & Growth
*Goal: Turn visitors into customers.*
- [ ] **Paddle Integration**: Hook up the payment approval once received.
- [ ] **Waitlist Automation**: Connect the email form to a database (Supabase/Firebase/EmailOctopus).
- [ ] **Referral Loop**: "Share your creation and get 2 free books."

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Refine Mobile Navigation** (The burger menu).
