# Artisan AI: The 2026 Power Plan (Kit 2.0 Orchestration)

This blueprint outlines how we will leverage the **Antigravity 2.0 Mission Control** and **Gemini Conductor** updates to transform Artisan AI from a single-author tool into an autonomous publishing factory.

---

## 🚀 1. The "Human Soul" Writing Engine (Researcher + Researcher + Copywriter)
*Goal: Eliminate the 'AI smell' and produce prose that connects emotionally with readers.*

- **Action**: Use the **Researcher Agent** + **FireCrawl** to scrape Top-100 KDP reviews in our target genre.
- **Implementation**: Feed these emotional "triggers" (what readers loved vs. hated) into the **Copywriter Agent**.
- **Result**: Every chapter generated will be "Context-Aware," specifically avoiding the clichés that human readers complain about in modern AI books.

## 🎨 2. Autonomous Covers & Visual Branding (Design Lead + Nano Banana Pro)
*Goal: Create best-seller quality covers without manual intervention.*

- **Action**: The **Design Lead** will orchestrate **Nano Banana Pro** to generate multi-variant cover concepts (Front, Back, and Spine) in parallel.
- **Implementation**: Use **Loki Mode** to create 5 different design directions (e.g., Minimalist, Gritty, Vibrant) simultaneously.
- **Result**: Users get a "Designer's Choice" gallery of 5 premium, KDP-sized wraps within seconds of project initialization.

## 🛡️ 3. Zero-Fail Manufacturing (Nerd Agent + Compliance Officer)
*Goal: 100% acceptance rate on KDP Print-on-Demand (POD).*

- **Action**: The **Nerd (QA) Agent** will perform **Visual Verification** of the generated PDF interior using the Antigravity Browser Extension.
- **Implementation**: The agent will "see" the gutters, bleed lines, and page numbers as if a human was reviewing a physical proof.
- **Result**: No more "Bleed Issues" or "Spine Mismatch" rejection emails from Amazon. If the Nerd sees a margin collision, it patches the `exportService.ts` code automatically.

## 📈 4. The "Loki Mode" Series Factory (Product Manager + DevOps)
*Goal: From "Standalone Book" to "Full Series Empire" in one click.*

- **Action**: Use **Loki Mode** to spawn three agents at once:
    - **Builder**: Writes the plot architecture for Books 1-3.
    - **SEO Architect**: Researches 7-keyword backend slots for the entire series.
    - **DevOps**: Sets up the **Modal** serverless queue to handle massive image rendering for all covers.
- **Result**: You aren't just building a book; you're building a brand.

## 🧠 5. Total Project Recall (Gemini Conductor)
*Goal: Seamless narrative continuity in 100,000+ word series.*

- **Action**: Map all character bibles, world-building rules, and lore into **Conductor Tracks** (`world_building.md`, `character_arc.md`).
- **Implementation**: Agents use the **Pinecone MCP** to search these tracks before writing any new chapter.
- **Result**: A character mentioned in Chapter 1 will never "forget" their eye color or tragic backstory in Chapter 50. Total lore consistency.

## 🛠️ Immediate Next Steps for Artisan AI
1.  **Activate "Loki Launch"**: Trigger parallel generation for the current project.
2.  **Deploy SEO Dockets**: Use the **SEO Architect** to generate a pre-flight report for the Amazon Algorithm.
3.  **Run Visual Audit**: Summon the **Nerd Agent** to verify the latest 8.5" x 8.5" Square trim PDF.
